Info about who I am as a contributor, along with some personal stuff for fun.
# Mission
My end goal for my career in working with computers is to have helped in creating efficeint and easy to use solutions that anyone can pick up and use, as well as encourage and increase overall computer fluency as computers move to become an integral part in all of the worlds processes. I also seek for all of my contributions (that arent video games) to be free and open source, so that I can help the world of computers become as accessible and free as it possibly can be.
# About
Hello there! My name is Avery and I use She/Ze pronouns! I am a beginning coder who is hoping to be able to contribute to a lot of open source work and volunteer projects in the future. For now, I'd love to read and hear about projects related to open-source, non-profit, or volunteer work so that I can grow as a programmer and hopefully contribute on those types of projects in the future!
